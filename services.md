## **Teaching Philosophy**

### Evidence-Based Approach
- Strong emphasis on **interactive learning** using online quizzes, coding assignments, and project-based assessments.
- Focus on **conceptual clarity** with practical exercises, such as Python notebooks hosted on [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi/).

### Key Principles
1. Keep lectures concise and targeted to specific learning goals.
2. Provide curated resources, including textbooks ([Machine Learning: The Basics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-8193-6)), YouTube playlists, and GitHub repositories.
3. Foster a feedback-adaptive teaching cycle while maintaining a consistent course schedule.

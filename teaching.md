## A Three-Component Picture of Machine Learning

Machine learning methods have been and are currently popularized in virtually any field of 
science and technology. As a result, machine learning courses attract students from different 
study programs. Thus, a key challenge in teaching basic machine learning courses is the heterogeneity 
of student backgrounds. To cope with this challenge, I have developed a new teaching 
concept for machine learning. 

This teaching concept revolves around three main components of machine learning: data, models and 
loss functions. By decomposing every machine learning methods into specific design choices for data 
representation, model and loss function, students learn to navigate the vast landscape of machine 
learning methods and applications.

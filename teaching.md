title: "A Three-Component Perspective on Machine Learning"

Most of us have witnessed the accelerating impact of artificial 
intelligence (AI) on our lives. Few of us are not consuming AI 
in one form or another. Based on AI systems' recommendations, 
we chose our jobs, partners, and the following video. The core 
technology behind most current AI systems is machine learning (ML). 

A consequence of the recent AI hype is an increasing demand for 
accessible introductions to ML concepts. One challenge in providing 
high-quality introductions to ML is the audience's diversity and needs. 

Right from my start on the tenure track at Aalto University, I was 
faced with serving rapidly growing student cohorts in my ML courses. 
To this end, I have developed a simple three-component picture of ML. 
This picture simplifies and structures the learning process for students 
from diverse fields.

The three fundamental components of ML are 

1. **Data Representation**  
2. **Model Design**  
3. **Loss Functions**

We can decompose any ML method into these three components. Linear regression 
is obtained for one specific design choice for data, model and loss. Using 
a different design choice for the model results in deep learning methods. 
Reinforcement learning methods are characterized by using reward signals 
to construect loss functions.

The principles of this framework are extensively discussed in my textbook:  
**[Machine Learning: The Basics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-8193-6)**  
*A. Jung, Springer, 2022.*

## Evidence-Based Approach
- Strong emphasis on **interactive learning** using online quizzes, coding assignments, and project-based assessments.
- Focus on **conceptual clarity** with practical exercises, such as Python notebooks hosted on [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi/).

## Key Principles
1. Keep lectures concise and targeted to specific learning goals.
2. Provide curated resources, including textbooks ([Machine Learning: The Basics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-8193-6)), YouTube playlists, and GitHub repositories.
3. Foster a feedback-adaptive teaching cycle while maintaining a consistent course schedule.

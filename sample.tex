\section*{Sample}

In the context of machine learning (ML), a sample is a finite sequence
 (of length $m$) of data points, ${\bf z}^{(1)}, \ldots, {\bf z}^{(m)}$.
 The number $m$ is called the sample size.
 Empirical risk minimization (ERM)-based methods use a sample to train a model (or learn a
 hypothesis) by minimizing the average loss (the empirical risk) over that sample.
 Since a sample is defined as a sequence, the same data point may
 appear more than once. By contrast, some authors in statistics define a sample
 as a set of data points, in which case duplicates are not allowed \cite{Everitt2010,OxfordStatisticsDictionary}.
 These two views can be reconciled by regarding a sample as a sequence of
 featureâ€“label pairs, $\left( {\bf x}^{(1)},y^{(1)} \right), \ldots,
 \left( {\bf x}^{(m)},y^{(m)} \right)$. The $r$-th
 pair consists of the features ${\bf x}^{(r)}$ and the label $y^{(r)}$
 of an unique underlying data point $\widetilde{{\bf z}}^{(r)}$. While the
 underlying data points $\widetilde{{\bf z}}^{(1)},\ldots,\widetilde{{\bf z}}^{(m)}$
 are unique, some of them can have identical features and labels.

 Each element of this sample consists of the feature vector
 and the label of a data point from an underlying population.
 The same data point may occur more than once in the sample.

 For the analysis of machine learning (ML) methods, it is common to interpret (the generation of) a
 sample as the realization of a stochastic process indexed by $\{1,\ldots,m\}$.
 A widely used assumption is the independent and identically distributed assumption (i.i.d.\ assumption), where sample elements
 $\left( {\bf x}^{(r)},y^{(r)} \right)$,
 for $r=1,\ldots,m$, are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (RVs) with a common probability distribution. \\

# Towards Trustworthy AI via Federated and Explainable Machine Learning

I am dedicated to advancing the frontiers of **trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI)**. My research 
focuses on exploring the fundamental limits and developing practical methods for federated learning 
and explainable AI. These efforts are supported by several prestigious grants:

- **A Mathematical Theory of Trustworthy Federated Learning (MATHFUL)**  
  *Funded by the Research Council of Finland (Decision #363624)*  
  [More Info](https://research.fi/en/results/funding/81387)

- **A Mathematical Theory of Federated Learning (TRUST-FELT)**  
  *Funded by the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (Decision #A835)*

## Federated Learning: Computational and Statistical Innovations

### Federated Learning for Network-Structured Data

The era of **big data over networks** demands solutions for handling interconnected, heterogeneous datasets. 
A prime example is pandemic management, where wearables and smartphones generate local datasets tied by 
physical, social, or biological network structures. These datasets often vary in statistical properties but exhibit 
intrinsic relationships.

My research introduces **networked exponential families**, a cutting-edge probabilistic model that addresses these challenges. The model enables:

- **Adaptive Data Pooling**: Groups similar datasets to build personalized predictions.
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Ensures data confidentiality in federated settings.
- **Scalable Optimization**: Employs robust methods to handle imperfections in data and computation.

## Explainable AI (XAI): Personalized and Transparent Models

### Building Trust Through Personalized Explainability

For AI systems to gain widespread acceptance, their predictions must be explainable. My research 
focuses on developing **personalized explanations** tailored to individual users. By measuring the 
reduction in **conditional entropy**, this method ensures that explanations align with the user's knowledge and needs.

#### Key Features

- **User-Centric Explanations**: Accounts for user background and preferences.
- **Model-Agnostic Framework**: Compatible with any machine learning model.
- **Efficient Implementation**: Requires minimal training dataâ€”just data points, predictions, and user-provided summaries.

## Computational and Statistical Aspects of Total Variation Minimization for Federated Learning

### Federated Learning for Network-Structured Data

Modern applications generate interconnected datasets with inherent network structures (**big data over networks**). 
A prominent use case is pandemic management, where smartphones and wearables collect biophysical parameters. 
These local datasets are often heterogeneous but exhibit statistical relationships through physical ("contact networks"), 
social, or biological proximity.

I have recently introduced**networked exponential families**â€”a novel probabilistic model for analyzing big data over networks. 
This model enables:
- Adaptive pooling of statistically similar datasets to create personalized predictions.
- Robust, privacy-preserving, and scalable distributed optimization techniques.
- Effective handling of statistical and computational imperfections.

## Explainable AI (XAI)

### Personalized Explainable Machine Learning

Explainability is essential for the widespread adoption of AI systems. My research focuses on 
creating personalized explanations for machine learning predictions. The core idea involves 
measuring the **effectiveness of explanations** through their impact on reducing the conditional 
entropy of predictions, tailored to the user's background knowledge.

#### Highlights of the Method:

- **Personalized Explanations**: Tailored to the user's understanding, using summaries that reflect their background knowledge.
- **Model-Agnostic**: Applicable across different machine learning models.
- **Training Data Efficient**: Requires only data points, predictions, and user-provided summaries.

During my academic career, Iâ€™ve taught and mentored thousands of students in machine learning and related fields. 
I am passionate about breaking down complex concepts into clear, practical, and insightful materials that resonate 
with learners and professionals alike. I particularly enjoy crafting textbooks that offer accessible introductions to the 
core ideas of machine learning, bridging the gap between theory and application.

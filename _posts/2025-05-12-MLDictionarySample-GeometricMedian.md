The **geometric median** $\boldsymbol{z}$ of a set of vectors $\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{x}^{(n)}$ minimizes the total Euclidean distance:

$$
\boldsymbol{z} \in \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left\| \boldsymbol{y} - \boldsymbol{x}^{(i)} \right\|_2.
$$

This makes it a robust alternative to the mean when data includes outliers.

Welcome to my portfolio of educational offerings, developed over a decade of experience in education, 
curriculum development, and mentoring. My approach to teaching combines innovative methods, 
hands-on exercises, and a strong focus on student learning outcomes.

## **Core Offerings**

### **Machine Learning Curriculum Design and Delivery**
At Aalto University, I have designed and implemented several courses that form the backbone of a 
machine learning curricula (Bachelor and Master level). Some of these courses have also been offered 
to adult learners via the [**Finnish Institute of Technology (FITech.io)**](https://fitech.io/en/about-fitech/). 
I have also designed the summer school  [**Human-Centered Machine Learning**](assets/HCLSS.pdf) 
offered at Aalto University in 2022 for the [**European University Networks for Innovation, Technology and Engineering (Unite!)**](https://www.unite-university.eu/).

###  **Customised Tutorials, Seminars and Workshops for Industry**. [Here are more details.](/ml-bootcamp/)
- **Executive Education**: Led tailored programs like "Diploma in Artificial Intelligence" for [Aalto Executive Education](https://www.aaltoee.fi/)
- **International Bootcamps**: Facilitated intensive learning experiences such as the "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Workshop" at Salo IoT campus.


### **Your Personal ML Coach**
With extensive experience supervising over [100 Masterâ€™s theses](/assets/MasterThesisSupervisedNov24.pdf), 
I provide guidance on topics such as:
- Machine learning applications (e.g., Federated Learning, Network Intrusion Detection).
- AI in industry contexts (e.g., Art Fraud Detection, Predictive Maintenance).
- Advanced research in Explainable AI and Reinforcement Learning.

## **Teaching Philosophy**

### Evidence-Based Approach
- Strong emphasis on **interactive learning** using online quizzes, coding assignments, and project-based assessments.
- Focus on **conceptual clarity** with practical exercises, such as Python notebooks hosted on [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi/).

### Key Principles
1. Keep lectures concise and targeted to specific learning goals.
2. Provide curated resources, including textbooks ([Machine Learning: The Basics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-8193-6)), YouTube playlists, and GitHub repositories.
3. Foster a feedback-adaptive teaching cycle while maintaining a consistent course schedule.

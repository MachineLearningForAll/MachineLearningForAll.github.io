## üåü **Machine Learning Curriculum Design and Delivery**

I have designed and implemented core courses for machine learning curricula 
at Aalto University (Bachelor and Master level). These include courses offered 
to adult learners via [**Finnish Institute of Technology (FITech.io)**](https://fitech.io/en/about-fitech/) 
and the [**Human-Centered Machine Learning Summer School**](assets/HCLSS.pdf) (2022), 
organized for the [**Unite! European University Network**](https://www.unite-university.eu/).

### üì£ **Testimonial from a Co-Lecturer**

*"...I like to take the opportunity to express that, in my opinion, Alex has generated a very strong, 
didactically excellent course with a good focus on the necessary basic concepts and principles. 
It mixes theory and focused exercises with a machine learning project in which students grow while 
applying their learned knowledge on actual data.  From last year to this year, the course has been 
further improved significantly by rigorously addressing the feedback collected by the students."*

### üì£ **Testimonial from VP Education of Aalto University**

*"I learnt to know Alex in 2015 in my earlier role, VP Education of Aalto University, when Alex joined thefaculty of Aalto University School of Science as an Assistant Professor. My first impression was hisdedication and passion to create powerful learning experience to all his students. It was no surprisethat the student feedback was extremely positive since day one."*

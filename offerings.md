## **Machine Learning Curriculum Design and Delivery**
At Aalto University, I have designed and implemented several courses that form the backbone of a 
machine learning curricula (Bachelor and Master level). Some of these courses have also been offered 
to adult learners via the [**Finnish Institute of Technology (FITech.io)**](https://fitech.io/en/about-fitech/). 
I have also designed the summer school  [**Human-Centered Machine Learning**](assets/HCLSS.pdf) 
offered at Aalto University in 2022 for the European [**University Network for Innovation, Technology and Engineering (Unite!)**](https://www.unite-university.eu/).

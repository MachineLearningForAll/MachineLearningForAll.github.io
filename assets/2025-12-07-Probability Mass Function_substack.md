The pmf of a discrete random variable (RV)  is a function
 that assigns
to each possible value  of the random variable (RV)
 the probability
 (Papoulis and
Pillai 2002). Fig. [1](#fig_pmf_dict){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig_pmf_dict"} illustrates the pmf of a discrete random
variable (RV) .

![The pmf  of a discrete random variable (RV)
 taking values in the set . Three
datasets are also shown whose relative frequencies of data points match
this pmf exactly. Such datasets could arise as realizations of
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (RVs)
sharing the common pmf . []{#fig_pmf_dict

A pmf always satisfies
. We can view a
pmf as representing a collection of (sufficiently long) datasets. This
collection contains any ,
with the relative frequencies of every value  being
close to the corresponding pmf value ,
 Note that requiring relative
frequencies to be close to the probability mass function (pmf) values
implies that the empirical entropy of such a dataset is close to the
entropy of the probability mass function (pmf)
. Information theory refers to the collection
of such datasets as the typical set corresponding to the probability
mass function (pmf)  (Cover and Thomas 2006).
A main result of information theory states that a dataset generated by
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling from
 belongs, with high probability, to the
typical set with respect to  (Cover and
Thomas 2006, Th. 3.1.2).\
